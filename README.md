# VirtualMoCap_Unity
Repo for Unity project "Virtual karate"

This is my graduation project. I tried to use google MoveNet motion capture model inside Unity. To run and use this project you need to download thunder version of MoveNet and implement connection to local server on Python or other programming language

I used Python for MoveNet model cause it was very simple to run MoveNet on Python.

Local server starts inside Unity script
